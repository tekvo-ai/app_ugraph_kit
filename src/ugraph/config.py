"""
config.py — where the knowledge base lives, and what vocabulary it uses.

This module exists because the original implementation hardcoded a single Obsidian
vault path. Everything else in the toolchain was already portable; only the root was
not. Resolving the root from config instead of an import is what turns a personal
script into a tool other people can run.

Resolution order for the KB root, first hit wins:
    1. explicit --kb argument              (CLI flag)
    2. UGRAPH_KB environment variable
    3. `kb` key in the nearest ugraph.toml    (walking up from cwd)
    4. the directory containing ugraph.toml
    5. cwd, if it looks like a KB (has SCHEMA.md or concepts/)

A KB is just a directory. It can sit inside an Obsidian vault, a git repo, or
nowhere in particular — the format does not care, which is the point.
