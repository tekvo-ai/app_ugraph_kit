"""
status.py — where the knowledge base extraction actually stands.

`lint` answers "is it valid?". This answers "how much is done?" — which sources are
extracted, which transcripts have candidates waiting, and how the concept graph is
distributed. Built for the cluster-by-cluster extraction workflow, where the question
between batches is always "what's left and what should I do next?".

The module is split in two on purpose:

    collect(config) -> dict     every number, no formatting
    render(stats, ...) -> str   one terminal view of those numbers

Nothing here prints. `collect()` is the part worth reusing — a dashboard, a CI check
that fails when canonicalization regresses, or a test asserting on counts all want the
numbers and none of them want a progress bar. The CLI owns argument parsing and output.
